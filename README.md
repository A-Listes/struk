# Data Structures
**ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Data Structures class project repository!** 

In this repository, my collegue [A-Listes](https://github.com/A-Listes) and I implemented key data structures and algorithms as part of our coursework. 

The goal was to gain hands-on experience with common data structures like :
* linked lists
* stacks
* queues
* trees
* graphs

Additionally, we explore sorting algorithms, searching techniques, and problem-solving through various assignments.
